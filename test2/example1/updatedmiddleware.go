/*
What is middleware? 
When you're building a web application there's probably some shared functionality 
that you want to run for many (or even all) HTTP requests.
organising this shared functionality is to set it up as middleware â€” self-contained 
code which independently acts on a request before or after your normal application handlers.

Some operations, such as authentication, logging, and cookie validation, are 
often implemented as middleware functions, which act on a request independently 
before or after the regular route handlers.

 In Go a common place to use middleware is between a router
 and application handlers.
